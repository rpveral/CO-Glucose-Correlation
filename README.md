# CO-Glucose-Correlation
This is a NodeMCU mini project that attempts to correlate the Carbon Monoxide exhalation measurement with the glucose level in the blood

Materials used:

1 NodeMCU Mini microcontroller

1 MQ7 Carbon Monoxide sensor

1 set Cofee glucose measuring kit (for the correlation data)

Sensing Procedure:

The person will breathe on the opening of the apparatus

When the previous CO reading exceeds 40 units, sensing will begin (This usually happens immediately upon breathing onto the apparatus)

There will be a 10s delay for stabilized reading

Reading of the CO level will happen every 5s after the initial delay

Glucose level using the Cofee unit should be taken immediately after the last reading for the correlation data
